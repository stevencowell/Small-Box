<h2>Program Overview</h2>

<p>This Stage 5 small box unit runs for three weeks and introduces you to basic timber construction. Throughout the unit you will practise safe workshop routines while measuring, marking, cutting and assembling timber pieces to create a friction‑fit box with a divider. Each week builds on the last, developing both your practical ability and theoretical understanding.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Week 1 – Safety, Measuring &amp; Cutting:</strong> Learn workshop safety rules and practise accurate measuring and marking. You will prepare the box sides and base pieces by cutting to length using hand saws and small power tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 2 – Assembly &amp; Divider:</strong> Explore butt‑joint construction and the use of adhesives. You will glue and clamp the box components square and begin marking and cutting the friction‑fit divider.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 3 – Fitting, Sanding &amp; Finishing:</strong> Finalise the fit of the divider, then sand and finish the box with oils or waxes. You will evaluate your finished product against design criteria and reflect on your learning.</li>
</ol>

<p>This program aligns with the Stage 5 Industrial Technology syllabus and encourages you to develop practical skills, manage risk, solve problems creatively and reflect on your progress.</p>
