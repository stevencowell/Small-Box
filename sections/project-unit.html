<h2>Small Box Project</h2>

<p>In this unit you will design and construct a small timber box with a friction‑fit divider. The project combines careful measurement and cutting with simple butt‑joint assembly and finishing techniques. Your finished box can be used to store cards, craft items or small tools and will showcase your craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Throughout the course you will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select suitable timber and prepare the pieces for the box sides, base and divider.</li>
  <li>Measure, mark and cut accurately using hand and small power tools.</li>
  <li>Assemble the box using butt joints and adhesives, ensuring all corners are square.</li>
  <li>Cut and fit a friction‑fit divider so it slides into place but remains secure.</li>
  <li>Sand and finish the surfaces to protect the timber and enhance its appearance.</li>
  <li>Evaluate your finished product against design criteria and reflect on your learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project encourages creativity and craftsmanship while reinforcing safety and risk management in the workshop. Use the resources and activities throughout this website to support your learning.</p>
