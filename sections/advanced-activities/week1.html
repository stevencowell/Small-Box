  <summary><b>Advanced Week 1: Timber &amp; Joinery Analysis</b></summary>
  <article>
    <p>To extend your learning, investigate the properties of different timbers and alternative joinery methods. Selecting the right timber for a project involves considering hardness, grain pattern, stability and sustainability. Hardwood species such as jarrah or blackwood offer durability and attractive figure, while softwoods like pine are easier to work but less durable. Look for timber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or similar schemes to ensure it has been harvested responsibly.</p>
    <p>While our project uses simple butt joints, many other joints can be used for box construction. Dovetail, finger (box) and rabbet joints are stronger and more decorative but require greater precision or specialised tools. Choosing a joint involves balancing strength, aesthetics, available equipment and your skill level.</p>
