  <summary><b>Advanced Week 2: Adhesives &amp; Design Improvements</b></summary>
  <article>
    <p>Understanding different types of adhesives can help you choose the best glue for your project. Polyvinyl acetate (PVA) is the most common wood glue; it is easy to use, dries clear and is suitable for most indoor projects. Polyurethane glue expands as it cures, filling small gaps and providing a waterproof bond, but it requires precise clamping and personal protective equipment. Epoxy adhesives offer high strength and gap‑filling properties, ideal for challenging joints, but they are more expensive and require careful mixing.</p>
    <p>Beyond adhesives, consider how you might modify the basic box design to enhance its functionality or aesthetic appeal. Adding a lid, decorative inlays, contrasting timbers or alternative joints can elevate a simple project into a unique piece.</p>
