  <summary><b>Advanced Week 3: Finishing &amp; Evaluation</b></summary>
  <article>
    <p>Finishing not only protects the wood but also enhances its beauty. Natural oils penetrate the timber and bring out the grain, while waxes provide a soft sheen and tactile feel. Lacquers and varnishes create a hard, protective surface that resists wear and moisture, but they may alter the colour of the timber and contain solvents. Shellac offers a traditional finish with a warm glow but is less durable in wet conditions. Consider the environmental impact of each product — many modern oils and waxes are made from renewable resources.</p>
    <p>Self‑evaluation is an important part of craftsmanship. By reflecting on both strengths and weaknesses you can plan how to improve your skills and processes in future projects.</p>
